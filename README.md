# University of Cologne Japanese Studies Zotero Citation Style

This is a Zotero citation style `.csl` file for use by students at the department of Japanese Studies at the Institute for East Asian Studies, University of Cologne. It aims to implement all specific formatting instructions as laid out it https://japanologie.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/sites/ostas/japanologie/Wissenschaftliches\_Arbeiten/Richtlinien-Wiss-Arbeiten-2023\_bearbeitet.pdf (German, last accessed 2025-09-06) correctly. This is an independent student project and not affiliated with the Institute of East Asian studies in any way.

**Caution: The citation style is not yet complete or well-tested.** Most crucially, Japanese titles will not be correctly displayed. Adding Japanese titles after the transcribed title is not a workaround since Japanese symbols will be displayed in cursive. **Always double-check the generated bibliography!** Contributions are welcome.

## Installation

The `.csl` file can be downloaded and added to Zotero using `Bearbeiten > Einstellungen > Zitieren > +`. Once completed, it will be uploaded to the Zotero Style Repository.
